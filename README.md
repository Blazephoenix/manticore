# Manticore
=======
Manticore is my attempt at building a static site generator using Python.

It uses Markdown2 and the jinja templating engine to render static pages as output.
A lot of work remains to be done but the basic functionality is all there.

### To-do:
* Implement custom category, tag functionality.
* A CLI to automate the process
* Will add more as I think of them

### Steps to get started: 

- Create empty output folder
- Add posts in contend
- Run parse.py
- Run render.py
